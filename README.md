# WeatherWebsite

Weather website for Data Aqusition :coffee:

This website makes API calls to OpenWeatherMap on demand and stores the weather data in a database. The data that has been stored can then be viewed catergorized by the city with the corresponding weather data. Temperature that has been stored for a city in the database can also be compared to two other cities temperatures in three graphs. 

A data sharing api is avaiable on /api/{a city name}, e.g localhost:8080/api/Stockholm. The response is a JSON.
